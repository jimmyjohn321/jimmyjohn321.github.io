Why Hire an Auto Accident Attorney? See the Following Frequently Asked Questions.
Being in a car accident can leave you feeling a variety of emotions. Accident victims often feel:
Angry with the other driver
Frustrated with insurance companies and doctors
Anxious about covering medical bills and lost wages
Scared of losing their job or home

Most of all, victims of car accidents are often confused about their options and next steps. 

Knowing whether you need to hire a personal injury lawyer can be one of the most challenging parts of the process. Maybe you've considered hiring an attorney, but you don't know where to begin. Do you even need a lawyer? Can you afford legal fees? Was your accident serious enough to make hiring a lawyer necessary? Or maybe you’ve been told that you don't need to hire an attorney, making you hesitant to contact one. These issues can feel overwhelming, even for experienced drivers or those who have been in multiple accidents.

If you have been injured in an auto or motorcycle accident and you have unanswered questions, the good news is that you're not alone, and we’re here to help. The following Frequently Asked Questions can help you to learn whether hiring an auto accident attorney is the right choice for you.

When Should You Call an Auto Accident Attorney?
The short answer is “As soon as possible.” This is true whether your injuries are minor or catastrophic. If you’re wondering whether calling an attorney right after an accident is really necessary, keep in mind that the insurance company has certainly already notified its attorneys to make them aware of your accident. The insurance company will already be taking steps towards reducing your future recovery, putting you at a disadvantage. Having an attorney working on your behalf from day one will help to ensure that you are receiving advice which is best for you and your family, and not for their bottom line. 

That being said, most car accident victims don’t know that they need to hire an attorney until some time has passed after an accident. Perhaps you thought you could handle the matter yourself. Maybe you didn’t realize the extent of your injuries at first. Or maybe you thought you didn’t need an attorney, or that you couldn’t afford one. Even if time has passed since your accident, there is still time to call an attorney. While calling right away is best, you can reach out to a lawyer anytime prior to the settlement of your case. Even - or perhaps especially - if you have received a settlement offer from the insurance company, Albers Injury Law can help you to receive all of the compensation you deserve. We can evaluate your offer, often negotiating for figures much higher than - sometimes even double or triple - what our clients would have received on their own. So whether it has been one day or one hundred (or more) since your accident, calling an attorney as early as possible can help to ensure that you are treated fairly and are adequately compensated for your losses.

How Much Does an Auto Accident Attorney Cost?
If you have been injured in an accident, and the accident was not your fault, then you likely qualify to have your fees for legal representation fall under what is known as a “contingency fee agreement.” A contingency fee is a fee which is collected by an attorney from the client’s winnings or settlement proceeds. In other words, any fees owed to your lawyer will be paid out of the funds that you receive as a result of your injuries. If your case is unsuccessful or you do not receive a settlement, then you will NOT be responsible for paying the firm for its time and expenses. This arrangement is both practical and beneficial, as it allows you to hire an attorney right away, regardless of your financial circumstances. Plus, because your attorney only recovers his fees if your case is successful, both you and your lawyer have the same goal: to receive as high of a recovery as possible. At Albers Injury Law of Illinois, even your initial consultation with our office is free. This means that even if our firm is unable to take on your case, you will never have to pay a legal fee out of pocket. Because there is no financial risk to hiring an attorney to represent you, calling our office is a win/win!
