Title: Why Hire an Auto Accident Attorney


If you have been in an accident, it is time to hire an auto accident attorney.
Top reasons to hire an attorney:

They understand time limits, and will work quickly to make sure all of the necessary documents and evidence is filed on time
They will work against insurance companies who will try and devalue your claim as soon as they get it
They can gather evidence before it disappears--consider this: after an accident, it's quite common for evidence to be erased to cover up negligence but an attorney knows what evidence to get, and how to get it fast. If, for example, you were hit by an 18-wheeler, good attorneys can get the black box data or Hours of Service logbook to prove a traffic infraction or an Hours of Service violation. 
They will prove liability in court, even if you were partially at fault
They will help you avoid mistakes--consider that one misguided statement to your insurance adjuster could prevent you from recovering compensation but an attorney will handle all communication for you so mistakes aren’t made.
They know when to settle, and how--good attorneys will ensure you get all recoverable damages you can and they won’t accept a settlement that is too low, too early, or postpone things like medical evaluations that could interfere with a settlement

Remember: you only have ONE chance to win a case. 
Why do people fail when attempting to represent themselves?
They fail for a lot of reasons like:
Failing to get a medical evaluation to substantiate injuries
Failing to submit evidence on time
Failing to provide insurance companies with required information
Failing to prove negligence and establish the fault of the other drivers
Failing to keep a record of damages and expenses after the accident
What Can a Car Accident Attorney Do For You?
If you have been in a car accident, you need to focus on recuperation and recovery, especially if you were injured. A qualified car accident attorney can take the reins from you while you recover. Remember, there is a statute of limitations on your case, a deadline that starts from the moment the accident happens. There are multiple deadlines throughout the process of a case for compensation and if you forget even one thing ever miss a single deadline it can mean no compensation.

A car accident attorney can work with the insurance adjusters on your behalf making sure that they don't do anything to devalue your case and ensuring you get the best possible compensation.

They can gather evidence were you might not be able to, making sure that your medical records have the language of court would require in order to prove that you received injuries and those injuries were a direct result of your car accident which was a direct result of another driver. A qualified attorney can get access to data that you might not be able to get like ascertaining cell phone records from a regular citizen to prove that they were texting while driving.

They also know when and where compensation is deserved, and how much is deserved. With out that knowledge you might accidentally settle or an amount that is far less than what you deserve but with an attorney, you have someone on your side.
What to Ask When Hiring an Attorney
When hiring an attorney there are some questions you should always ask during your consultation:

What experience do you have with my specific type of injury?
What percentage of my case will you actually be responsible for handling?
How much of your practice is dedicated to auto accident cases?
What, if any, up-front fees or expenses will I be responsible for covering?

Knowing the specifics about fee structures, what the attorney will do for you, and how well qualified they are will narrow down your list of potential attorneys easily.
